This project is about predicting the Wine quality by applying Neural Network - a deep learning technique.

My mission is to create a AI system that can predict the quality of a wine. In order to do that, first, I will get the data provided by customer in the folder "additional_resources/datasets/Wine Quality/wine.csv"

Then, I will explore and clean the data (no missing values). 
After that, I will define the problems as its classification or regression problems.

In machine learning, it is customary to have a baseline model. Thus, the first step of this project is to get a very simple architecture to work with the standard, unmodified data.

## **The steps to build a baseline model using Keras**
1. Load Data.
2. Define Keras Model.
3. Compile Keras Model.
4. Fit Keras Model.
5. Evaluate Keras Model.
6. Tie It All Together.
7. Make Predictions
