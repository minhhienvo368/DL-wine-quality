This project is about predicting the Wine quality by applying Neural Network - a deep learning technique.

My mission is to create a AI system that can predict the quality of a wine. In order to do that, first, I will get the data from: ../../additional_resources/datasets/Wine Quality/wine.csv.
Then, I will explore and clean the data (no missing values). 
After that, I will define the problems as its classificative or regressive problems.
Next steps will be:

  + Feature engineering
  + Feature normalization
  + Resampling
  + Hyper-parameter tuning
      + Change the learning rate
      + Change the loss function
  + Modify the architecture
      + Number of layers
      + Number of neurons per layer
      + Activation functions

In machine learning, it is customary to have a baseline model. Thus, the first step of this project is to get a very simple architecture to work with the standard, unmodified data.
